# MR2H
Monster Rancher 2 Helper

Installation and use instructions:

<b>MR2H currently only works with pSX.</b>

1. Download pSX (http://www.emulator-zone.com/download.php/emulators/psx/psx_em/pSX_1_13.rar).
2. Extract the files in MR2 Helper.zip wherever you want, just keep the files together.  
   (You don't need the source unless you want to change something or are curious.)
3. Run the emulator.
4. Run Monster Rancher 2 Helper.

Notes: You don't have to do what it says, if you don't have Nuts Oil and it wants you to use Nuts Oil it'll adjust it's recommendations based on the actions you take.  
When it recommends you do a HD, LD or Rest it's doing so considering the current stats you have, not what you'll have after using the item it recommends.
