Note: You don't have to do what it says, if you don't have Nuts Oil and it wants you to use Nuts Oil 
it'll adjust it's recommendations based on the actions you take.  When it recommends you do a HD, LD or Rest
it's doing so considering the current stats you have. It's not looking at what you'll have after using 
the item it recommends for this.
